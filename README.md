<h1 align="center">TSB-UAD</h1>
<h2 align="center">An End-to-End Benchmark Suite for Univariate Time-Series Anomaly Detection</h2>


TSB-UAD is a new open, end-to-end benchmark suite to ease the
evaluation of univariate time-series anomaly detection methods. Overall, TSB-UAD
contains 12686 time series with labeled anomalies spanning
different domains with high variability of anomaly types, ratios,
and sizes. Specifically, TSB-UAD includes 18 previously proposed
datasets containing 1980 time series from real-world data science applications. 
Motivated by flaws in certain datasets and evaluation strategies in the literature,
we study anomaly types and data transformations to contribute
two collections of datasets. Specifically, we generate 958 time series
using a principled methodology for transforming 126 time-series
classification datasets into time series with labeled anomalies. In
addition, we present a set of data transformations with which we
introduce new anomalies in the public datasets, resulting in 10828
time series (92 datasets) with varying difficulty for anomaly detection.

## Anomaly Detectors

We use 13 anomaly detection methods proposed for univariate time series. the following table lists and describes the methods considered in our benchmark:

| Anomaly Detection Method    | Description|
|:--|:---------:|
|Isolation Forest (IForest) | This method constructs the binary tree based on the space splitting and the nodes with shorter path lengths to the root are more likely to be anomalies. |
|The Local Outlier Factor (LOF)| This method computes the ratio of the neighboring density to the local density. |
|The Histogram-based Outlier Score (HBOS)| This method constructs a histogram for the data and the inverse of the height of the bin is used as the outlier score of the data point. |
|Matrix Profile (MP)| This method calculates as anomaly the subsequence with the most significant 1-NN distance. |
|NORMA| This method identifies the normal pattern based on clustering and calculates each point's effective distance to the normal pattern. |
|Principal Component Analysis (PCA)| This method projects data to a lower-dimensional hyperplane, and data points with a significant distance from this plane can be identified as outliers. |
|Autoencoder (AE)|This method projects data to the lower-dimensional latent space and reconstructs the data, and outliers are expected to have more evident reconstruction deviation. |
|LSTM-AD| This method build a non-linear relationship between current and previous time series (using Long-Short-Term-Memory cells), and the outliers are detected by the deviation between the predicted and actual values. |
|Polynomial Approximation (POLY)| This method build a non-linear relationship between current and previous time series (using polynomial decomposition), and the outliers are detected by the deviation between the predicted and actual values. |
| CNN | This method build a non-linear relationship between current and previous time series (using convolutional Neural Network), and the outliers are detected by the deviation between the predicted and actual values. |
|One-class Support Vector Machines (OCSVM)| This method fits the dataset to find the normal data's boundary. |
|*Discord Aware Matrix Profile (DAMP)*| *This method is a scalable matrix Profile-based approach proposed to solves the twin-freak problem.* |
|*SAND*| *This method identifies the normal pattern based on clustering updated through arriving batches (i.e., subsequences) and calculates each point's effective distance to the normal pattern. This method can be used either online and offline.* |
|*Series2Graph*| *This method is converting the time series into a directed graph reprenting the evolution of subsequences in time. The anomalies are detected using the weight and the degree of the nodes and edges respectively.* |

You may find more details (and the references) in our [paper](https://www.paparrizos.org/papers/PaparrizosVLDB22b.pdf). In italics are methods that are available but not evaluated yet.

## Overall Results

We report in the following table the average AUC-ROC and F score for each method on each dataset. The accuracy scores are averaged for all the time series in each dataset.

Here we only report the average accuracy (AUC-ROC and F score) for each dataset. You may find [here](https://github.com/TheDatumOrg/TSB-UAD/tree/main/result/accuracy_table) the accuracy tables for each time series and each accuracy measure.

We then compare the accuracy scores of the anoamly detection methods on time series containing point versus sequence anomalies and a single versus multiple anomalies. The following figure summarize the results:

This figure and many others comparisons are described (and reproductible) in [this notebook](https://github.com/TheDatumOrg/TSB-UAD/blob/main/result/accuracy_evaluation/Statistical_Analysis_TSB.ipynb), summarized in [this document](https://github.com/TheDatumOrg/TSB-UAD/blob/main/result/accuracy_evaluation/Statistical_Analysis_TSB.pdf).
The scripts to reproduce the critical diagrams and the statistical tests are [here](https://github.com/TheDatumOrg/TSB-UAD/tree/main/result/statistical_test).




## Usage

### Anomaly Detector

We depicts below a code snippet demonstrating how to use one anomaly detector (in this example, IForest).

```python
import os
import pandas as pd
from TSB_UAD.core import tsb_uad


df = pd.read_csv('data/benchmark/ECG/MBA_ECG805_data.out', header=None).to_numpy()
data = df[:, 0].astype(float)
label = df[:, 1]
results = tsb_uad(data, label, 'IForest', metric='all')

metrics = {}
for metric in results.keys():
    metrics[metric] = [results[metric]]
    print(metric, ':', results[metric])

df = pd.DataFrame(data=metrics)
df.to_csv(os.path.join('./all_metrics.csv'))
```

```
